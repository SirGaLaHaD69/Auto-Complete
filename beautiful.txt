Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick that mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
And I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and tried to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips, with the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shits so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, copy, one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you have to walk a thousand miles
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
It's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation, like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking manservant
Trying to follow me around, and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like hahaha
Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't have to trade our shoes
And you don't have to walk no thousand miles
In my shoes, just to see
What it's be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own, I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid, Aunt Edna always told me
Keep making that face till it gets stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
Holding my tongue up trying to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on the frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson and cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
Is probably a hundred and ten percent different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes, at least
What size you wear? I wear tens
Let's see if you can fit your feet
In my shoes, just to see
What it's be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you
Yea, to my babies, stay strong, Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world, God gave you the shoes
That fit you, so put em on and wear 'em
And be yourself man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful, so
